Simplify elements that are identical, then recombine the elements into a shape. Each step is outlined in detail and different examples are given. Most of the book has been written over, angrily, by another mage who appears to be arguing for a different method of sigil creation involving a number wheel and simplifying the letters in the statement rather than the shapes. The handwritten notes make lengthy arguments disproving the author's claims. A second set of handwriting has added some sarcastic and passive aggressive commentary to the first note-takers comments and drawn several rude drawings. ",
